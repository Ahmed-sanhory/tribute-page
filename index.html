    <p class="main-paragraph">Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized as Alhazen; /ælˈhæzən/; 
        full name Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan 
        ibn al-Haytham أبو علي، الحسن بن الحسن بن الهيثم; c. 965 – c. 1040) was a medieval mathematician, 
        astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age from present-day Iraq.<br><br>to as 
        "the father of modern optics",he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and 
        visual perception in particular.<br><br>His most influential work is titled Kitāb al-Manāẓir
         (Arabic: كتاب المناظر, "Book of Optics"), written during 1011–1021, which survived in 
         a Latin edition.The works of Alhazen were frequently cited during the scientific 
         revolution by Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Christiaan Huygens, and Galileo Galilei.<br><br>

        Ibn al-Haytham was the first to correctly explain the theory of vision,and to argue that
         vision occurs in the brain, pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by
          personal experience.He also stated the principle of least time for refraction which would later
           become the Fermat's principle.<br><br>He made major contributions to catoptrics and dioptrics by studying 
           reflection, refraction and nature of images formed by light rays.Ibn al-Haytham 
           was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments 
           based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning—an early pioneer in the scientific 
           method five centuries before Renaissance scientists.<br><br>On account of this, he is sometimes 
           described as the world's "first true scientist".He was also a polymath, writing on philosophy,
            theology and medicine.</p>
